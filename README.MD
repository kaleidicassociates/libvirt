Low-level bindings for libvirt.

Pre-alpha state: use at your peril.
I intend to add higher-level wrapper in time.

You will need to link with libvirt-qemu and libvirt-lxc if you use these modules

Alternative approach - just use dpp to translate headers on the fly.
see ex2.dpp in dpp_example to see how
